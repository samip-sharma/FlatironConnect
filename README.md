Flatiron-Connect

This project was created to connect all Flatiron students, students from same cohort and teachers.
There is admin users who will approve you for a cohort if you belong to any.  I am using action-cable for online presence.  The application is styled with custom CSS and also employs the Material Design Bootstrap framework.

+ Rails backend and React Redux frontend fullstack application
+ Uses Rails Actioncable for determining users online presence
+ Create events for each student cohort
+ Uses custom CSS styling and MBBootstrap for user interface
