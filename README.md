Flatiron-Connect

This project was created to connect all Flatiron students, students from same cohort and teachers.
There is admin users who will approve you for a cohort if you belong to any.  I am using action-cable for online presence.  The application is styled with custom CSS and also employs the Material Design Bootstrap framework.

+ Developed Rails backend and React Redux frontend fullstack application
+ Used Rails Actioncable for determining users online presence 
+ Created events for each student cohort using React-Big-Calendar
+ Implemented user interface with custom CSS styling and MBBootstrap
